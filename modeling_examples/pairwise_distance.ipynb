    "This optimization problem determines the positions of **$N$** points in a **$D$**-dimensional space such that the ratio of the maximum to minimum squared pairwise distances is minimized, which is addressed by **maximizing the minimum distance** in our formulation. This promotes a uniform distribution of points, minimizing clustering and maximizing spatial efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **decision variables** are defined below, with $\\mathcal{N}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ being the corresponding sets of points and dimensions, respectively:\n",
    "- $x_{i,k}$: Coordinate of point $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ in dimension $k \\in \\mathcal{D}$\n",
    "- $t_{\\min}$: Minimum squared distance between any two points\n",
    "- $t_{\\max}$: Maximum squared distance between any two points (fixed to 1)\n",
    "- $r$: Ratio variable, defined as $r = \\frac{1}{t_{\\min}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For all pairs of points $i,j \\in \\mathcal{N}$ where $i < j$, the squared Euclidean distance is **constrained** as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, we define the ratio variable by adding the constraint $r \\cdot t_{\\min} = 1$. Since the problem is *scale-invariant*, that is, the outcome of the problem does not change when all lengths are multiplied by the same constant factor, for simplicity we fix $t_{\\max} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective function** is to maximize the minimum squared distance: $\\max t_{\\min}$. This is equivalent to minimizing the ratio $\\frac{t_{\\max}}{t_{\\min}}$, since $t_{\\max}$ is fixed to 1. This reformulates the problem as a quadratic problem that can be handled by a specific solver (Xpress-SLP) instead of the generic Global solver.  The optimization is subject to a time limit defined by `LIMIT`.\n",
