    "In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a $n \\times n$ grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine $q \\times q$ subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to $n$. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.\n",

Although all cells must contain integer numbers, using integer decision variables would make it hard to guarantee that they are different within a given block (row/column) with a mathematical programming formulation. Alternatively, a Constraint Programming formulation can be applied, as shown in the blog post [Solving Sudoku: A Constraint Programming Play](https://community.fico.com/s/blog-post/a5Q4W000001V7gdUAC/fico2486).\n",
