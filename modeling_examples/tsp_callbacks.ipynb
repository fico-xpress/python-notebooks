There are specific callbacks for other problem types, too.\n",

    "[Using callback functions](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML/chCallbacks.html) is simple: \n",
    "  * the user first defines a function (say *myfunction*) with a specific signature that is to be run every time the branch-and-bound reaches a well-specified point\n",
    "  * secondly, the user specifies that the function is to be invoked every time the algorithm reaches a well-specified point calls a function (such as [problem.addcbpreintsol](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML/problem.addcbpreintsol.html)) with *myfunction* as its argument\n",
    "  * finally, the user runs the *optimize* command that launches the branch-and-bound, the simplex solver, or the barrier solver; it is while these are run that myfunction is called at the intended points (depending on the selected callback type, check the [list of callbacks accepted by the Xpress Optimizer](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter5.html?scroll=section5002))\n",

By using the [problem.addcbpreintsol](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML/problem.addcbpreintsol.html) solver callback, we will instruct the solver whether to accept (if no subtours) or discard (subtours exist) the solution found.
