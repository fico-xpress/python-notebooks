# FICO Xpress Python notebook examples

The FICO&reg; Xpress Python interface is a powerful tool for optimization modeling and solving. It allows users to leverage the capabilities of the FICO&reg; Xpress Solver directly within Python. Here are some key features:

1. **Modeling**: You can create and manipulate optimization models using Python objects. This includes defining variables, constraints, and objective functions. It allows creating constraints and objectives using expressions with operator overloading.
2. **Integration with NumPy and SciPy**: The interface supports the use of NumPy and SciPy sparse arrays, making it easier and more efficient to handle large datasets and perform numerical operations.
3. **Solving**: It provides functions to solve various types of optimization problems, including linear programming (LP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), quadratic programming (QP) and (general) nonlinear programming (NLP), and access to the full set of solver features available with Xpress.
4. **Callbacks**: Users can implement custom callbacks to interact with the optimization process, such as monitoring progress or modifying the solver's behavior.
5. **[Examples](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML/chExamples.html) and [Documentation](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML)**: The interface comes with extensive examples and documentation to help users get started and explore advanced features.

## Running the examples using GitHub codespaces

1. **Open Codespaces and create a codespace**:
   - Click on the **"Code"** (green) button on the [repository page](https://github.com/fico-xpress/python-notebooks).
   - On the **"Codespaces"** tab, select **"Create a Codespace on main"**. This will set up a cloud-based development environment for you.

2. **Open Python Notebook**:
   - Once the Codespace is created and the environment is ready (wait for the README preview to appear), you can open a Python notebook.
   - Navigate to a notebook file (with a `.ipynb` extension) within the Codespace.
   - Click on the notebook file to open it in the Jupyter interface.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Run a code cell in the Python notebook as you would normally do in a local environment.
   - When running for the first time, select "Install/Enable suggested extensions: Python + Jupyter" as suggested in the pop-up window at the top of the screen.
   - After installation, the Python environment is automatically selected when running the code cell again. You are all set to run all the code cells.
